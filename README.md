### Neural Net from scratch

My attempt to build a neural net from scratch. I'm interested in the maths,
so thought I'd build one from the base up, using pure numpy.

Currently, it's just a Softmax (linear) classifier, i.e. a single layer NN.

Next step is to build a NN with hidden layers.

Data generator simply makes an N-dimensional spiral dataset for testing purposes
